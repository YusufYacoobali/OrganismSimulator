Project: Organism-Simulator
Authors: Yusuf Yacoobali, Su Chong, Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes

This simulation keeps track of the population of predators, prey and plants alike.
Animals can eat each other, mate, get infected, be born and die.
It all depends on probability, animals statistics, time and wheather conditions.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
